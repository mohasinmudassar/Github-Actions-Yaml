It performs the following steps:
1. Checks out the code from GitHub.
2. Sets up Node.js and Angular CLI.
3. Installs dependencies.
4. Builds the Angular app for production.
5. Deploys the app to the specified S3 bucket using the jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@v0.5.0 action.
6. Configures AWS credentials using aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1 action.
7. Invalidates CloudFront cache to reflect changes made in the S3 bucket.
The deployment is triggered on push to the main branch. The AWS access keys and S3 bucket name are stored in GitHub Secrets.
